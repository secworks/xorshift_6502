# xorshift_6502
Implementation of the xorshift PRNG in MOS 6502 assembler


## Status
Not comnpleted. Does not work. **Do. Not. Use.**


## Introduction
The [Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift) algorithm by
Marsaglia is a fast, non secure PRNG algorithm.  This repo is for an
implementation of Xorshift in MOS 6502 assembler.
